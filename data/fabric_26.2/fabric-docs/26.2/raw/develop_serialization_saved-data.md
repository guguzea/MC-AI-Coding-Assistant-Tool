Saved Data is Minecraft's built-in solution to save data across sessions.

The data is saved to disk and reloaded when the game is closed and opened again. This data is usually scoped (e.g. the level). Data is written to the disk as [NBT](https://minecraft.wiki/w/NBT_format) and [Codecs](./codecs) are used to serialize/deserialize this data.

Let's look at a simple scenario where we need to save the number of blocks broken by the player. We can keep this count on the logical server.

We can use the `PlayerBlockBreakEvents.AFTER` event with a simple static integer field to store this value and post it as a chat message.

<<< @/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/Unreferenced.java#saved_data_example_scenario

Now, when you break a block, you'll see a message with the count.

If you restart Minecraft, load the world and start breaking blocks, you'll notice the count has reset. This is where we need Saved Data. We can then store this count, so that the next time you load the world, we can get the saved count and start incrementing it from that point.

## Saving Data {#saving-data}

`SavedData` is the main class responsible for managing the saving/loading of data. As it is an abstract class, you're expected to provide an implementation.

### Setting Up a Data Class {#setting-up-a-data-class}

Let's name our data class `SavedBlockData` and have it extend `SavedData`.

This class will contain a field to keep track of the number of blocks broken as well as a method to get and a method to increment this number.

<<< @/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/saveddata/SavedBlockData.java#basic_structure

For serializing and deserializing this data, we need to define a Codec. We can compose a Codec using various primitive Codecs provided by Minecraft.

You'll need a constructor with an `int` argument to initialize the class.

<<< @/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/saveddata/SavedBlockData.java#ctor

Then we can build a Codec.

<<< @/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/saveddata/SavedBlockData.java#codec

We should call `setDirty()` when data is actually modified, so Minecraft knows it should be saved to the disk.

<<< @/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/saveddata/SavedBlockData.java#set_dirty

Finally, we're required to have a `SavedDataType` that describes our saved data. The first argument corresponds to the name of the file that will be created in the `data` directory of the world.

<<< @/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/saveddata/SavedBlockData.java#type

### Accessing Saved Data {#accessing-saved-data}

As mentioned earlier, saved data can be associated with a scope like the current level. In this case, our data will be global. We can get the `DimensionDataStorage` of the server to add and modify our data. When using a `Level` scope, you'll use the same `getDataStorage` method on a `Level` instead of the `MinecraftServer`.

We'll put this logic into a utility method.

<<< @/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/saveddata/SavedBlockData.java#method

### Using Saved Data {#using-saved-data}

Now that we have everything set up, let's save some data.

We can reuse the first scenario and instead of incrementing the field, we can call our `incrementBlocksBroken` from our `SavedBlockData`.

<<< @/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/saveddata/ExampleModSavedData.java#event_registration

This should increment the value and save it to the disk.

If you restart Minecraft, load the world and break a block, you'll see that the previously saved count is now incremented.

If you go into the `data` directory of the world, you'll see a `.dat` file with the name of `saved_block_data.dat`.
Opening this file in a NBT reader will show how our data is saved within.
